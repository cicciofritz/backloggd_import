# backloggd_import
Unofficial backloggd script to import games in .csv file into account

This is only the beginning, nothing working here! Sorry

Script to import as a backlog in backloggd site games listed in a csv (i.e. from steam or epic library)

First the game as to be retrieved as a gameID from IGDB using their API.

Authentication through Twitch is required: please follow the "Account Creation" section here https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started

Actual search finds multiple results. 

Once a single gameID is found, a POST request to a backloggd authenticated section can be performed.

Stay tuned.

NB. I'm not a professional python/web developer, I'm not even a beginner with python/web. I use this small project to learn and more likely to make mistakes, any suggestions are welcome
